Various problem statement utilising various communication protocols for LPC2148 which has an ARM processor

- SPI (Use on-board Push button connected to EINT1 to demonstrate working of External Interrupt. When the button is pressed display 8-bit binary data on the on-board LEDs using SPI in LPC2148 Development Board)
- SPI ( Receive 8-bit data from serial input from PC using UART and display the 8-bit binary data on the on-board LEDs using SPI in LPC2148 Development Board )
- UART (Blueboard has one Potentiometer R8 connected to ADC 0.3. Read the analog value at POT R8 terminal and send the corresponding voltage value to PC over UART link. ADC 0 is a 10 bit resolution ADC. Turn the potentiometer cap to vary the analog values from 0 to Vmax. Analog voltage at PC serial terminal must show the analog voltage accurate to 2 decimal place)
